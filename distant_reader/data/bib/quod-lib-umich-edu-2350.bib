The library literature offers extensive discussion of UX and user-centered design for a range of library products and services, including websites (Bordac 2008; Kasperek, 2011; Swanson, 2011), library subject guides (Sonsteby, 2013), and search & web-scale discovery (Gross, 2011; Lown, 2013). While the focus of the case study is a website, the essential principles and process of A/B testing may be applied in any context characterized by a known UX problem, a definite design question, and relevant measurable user data. With the combined data from web analytics and user interviews for this case study, the library web committee formed the following experiment hypothesis: a homepage with Help or Services will generate increased website engagement compared to Learn, Connect, and Interact.
