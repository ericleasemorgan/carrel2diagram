quod-lib-umich-edu-5619		Anticipatory Design: Improving Search UX using Query Analysis and Machine Cues			.html	text/html	5820	432	61	Intention mining is a useful frame for the activity we will conduct as we work through how to apply anticipatory design to our search interfaces.[4] Given our searching culture and expectations, I will look at a series of research questions and possibilities for library search interactions in this article. And finally, I will look at the implications of this anticipatory model in relation to privacy and utility in hopes of understanding where we can introduce value to library search interactions and how tolerant our users are in accepting enhancements that depend on inference and knowledge of their contextual patterns and behavior. Interpretation and anticipation of contextual user data enables even more potential improvements within a search user interface, such as: Watching for semantic cues within search queries to suggest/show facets related to generic questions about library collections and services.
