quod-lib-umich-edu-7763		A Method of Improving Library Information Literacy Teaching With Usability Testing Data			.html	text/html	7717	433	55	It concludes that usability testing data can be analyzed and re-used to help bridge gaps and make connections between different library departments and roles and to motivate change in teaching practices that are informed by observations of local user behavior. Other large and small-scale library and information literacy and behavior studies use different methodologies such as in-depth interviews, surveys, and focus groups (Lee, 2008; Head & Eisenberg, 2009; Duke & Asher, 2012; Thomas, Tewell, & Wilson, 2017; Finder, Dent, & Lym, 2006). Given limited resources in academic libraries, where budget and time do not always allow for regular information literacy research projects, this practical re-use of usability testing data can help us better understand our users and therefore teach more effectively.
