This article examines projects at two academic libraries where space use data was collected multiple times per day for several months. These projects represent only one aspect of user research that we’ve conducted in our libraries, but we consider this data collection to be a useful starting point for librarians interested in improving UX within their physical spaces. This group was excellently positioned to help us collect space use data—they were already roaming the library each hour and the very nature of their work is meant to help us better understand student needs.
