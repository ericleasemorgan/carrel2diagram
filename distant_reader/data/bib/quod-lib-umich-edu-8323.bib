After an initial round of sessions, we spoke to a group of public librarians to understand what user populations might be missing (job seekers and ESL students getting resources and support from the public library) and who we should recruit more of (senior citizens and young parents). Sessions Sessions ran from one and half to two hours and started with one question: “Tell me about the last time you used your public library.” From there, participants led an organic discussion about how they use the library (or don’t), how they find out what’s going on in their community and in the world, and how they search for information online.
