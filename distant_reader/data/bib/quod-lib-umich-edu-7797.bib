Regardless of whether your sort is open or closed, if you’re running a small enough test, there are free tools that will let you do your card sorting online. Since this testing can produce such meaningful yields, it’s worth the initial investment of time: three to five think-aloud tests with your patrons should turn up plenty of fixes you want to make on your library website. The tasks don’t need to fall under a single theme but they should be related to actual patron needs and help to answer your questions about the website. Ask other librarians for task ideas; that way you’ll better understand their concerns about the website and you might even get them interested in usability testing.
