quod-lib-umich-edu-9845		What’s in a name? Does it really matter whether we call it UX, ethnography, or service design?			.html	text/html	1571	76	60	If anything, it should be called NowLib (!), as it is concerned with researching current user experience and designing services and products as a result. But as someone coming to user experience from a career in libraries, I have chiefly advocated that librarians should place ‘user experience’ front and center in our terminology, even if this potentially de-emphasizes ethnography or service design despite the obvious and independent value they both offer. Because I believe our effort is most fundamentally to uncover the real experience and behavior of our users and improve, or develop new, services in response to what we learn. If ethnography and service design can be understood as poles on a spectrum, with methods on one side and outcomes on the other, then user experience would be my term for the spectrum itself.
