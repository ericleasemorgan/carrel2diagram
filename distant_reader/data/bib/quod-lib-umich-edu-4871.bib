quod-lib-umich-edu-4871		A New Call for Submissions			.html	text/html	548	29	48	Print Share+ Twitter Facebook Reddit Mendeley Dialog Box was created at Weave’s founding with the goal to “...extend beyond the traditional book review section and feature critical dialogue not only with books but with other media that set the boundaries of library [user experience].” As new editors settle into our roles with the journal, we reconceive our original aims. This includes but is not limited to submissions taking the form of: Email or social media symposium Practitioner interviews Intermittent columns Ethnographic and/or personal narratives Interactive pieces, artwork, zines Visual note-taking from conferences “Thing Explainers” that break down difficult concepts and systems Addressing topics such as, but not limited to: Privacy Politics of measurement and assessment All forms of accessibility Implications of UX as an intersectional social justice issue UX as a reflection of organizational culture Analysis of power, labor, and organizing in design, UX, or library systems Engaging the concepts of maintenance, failure, and innovation We are interested in highlighting work from marginalized groups, precarious workers, students, and other voices absent from these subjects.
