Pat Meenan writes in the WebPagetest documentation that a milestone “isn’t a very good indicator of the actual end-user experience.” As pages grow and load a lot of content that is not visible to the user or off the screen (below the fold) the time to reach the load event is extended even if the user-visible content has long-since rendered... How to Measure Speed Index with WebPagetest Google develops and supports WebPagetest, the online open-source web performance diagnostic tool at WebPagetest.org, which uses virtual machines to simulate websites loading on various devices and with various browsers, throttling the network to demonstrate load times over slower or faster connections, and much more.
