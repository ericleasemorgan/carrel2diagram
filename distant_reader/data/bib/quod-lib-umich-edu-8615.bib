Instead of using remote and large-scale testing options, we chose a lean, iterative approach, and committed to two semesters of brief, weekly “guerrilla” usability sessions with student users. At the beginning of this project, we didn’t know a whole lot about conducting user testing, having relied mostly on survey responses, search logs, and Piwik website usage data to inform our initial redesign. (A similar method is also explored in Steve Krug’s 2010 testing bible Rocket Surgery Made Easy, though he never users the term “guerrilla”.) Whatever you call it, this type of research aims to identify usability issues and fix them as quickly as possible.
